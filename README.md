# LinearRegression-FuelPricing
This repository contains a linear regression model built with PyTorch to predict gasoline prices in Turkey based on three features: USD exchange rate, policy interest rate, and oil prices. The project also includes a 3D and 2D visualization of the model's predictions and the actual gasoline prices.
